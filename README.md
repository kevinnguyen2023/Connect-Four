# Connect-Four
Programmed a Connect Four game in C and MIPS assembly allowing the user to play against the bot.In this game, you have a 9 column, 6 row board. At the beginning, the first and last columns are populated with alternating player tokens. The computer will randomly pick which player (the human or the computer) moves first.  That player drops their token into one of the middle 7 columns of the board. (The leftmost and rightmost columns are already full). The next player then does the same thing.  At any point, if a player drops a token which completes a set of 5 tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), that player wins the game.
